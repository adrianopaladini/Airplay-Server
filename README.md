# AirPlay Server

Airplay Server is a macOS app that lives in the toolbar and turns your Mac into an Airplay server. It allows you to mirror content from other Macs, iPhones, and iPads.

Unlike Apple’s native Airplay, this app supports multiple simultaneous streams and works in resizable windows or fullscreen mode.

For iPhone users, unlike Apple’s built-in mirroring, it displays the iPhone screen while you continue using it.

## Installation

To install AirPlay Server, download it from the Mac App Store.
