# CastBuddy

CastBuddy is a macOS app that lives in the toolbar and turns your Mac into an Airplay server. It allows you to mirror content from other Macs, iPhones, and iPads.

Unlike Appleâ€™s native Airplay, this app supports multiple simultaneous streams and works in resizable windows or fullscreen mode.

For iPhone users, unlike Appleâ€™s built-in mirroring, it displays the iPhone screen while you continue using it.
